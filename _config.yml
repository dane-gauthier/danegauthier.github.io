 Hey, I’m Dane Gauthier. I’ve been solving desktop and cloud tech challenges for over 15 years, with a current focus on Azure Virtual Desktop. I’m exploring my next opportunity, and I put this together to share a bit of how I think and what I can bring to a team.

     When I’m not at my desk, I spend as much time outdoors as I can. I’m currently into wakesurfing and rollerblading, but my passion for skating runs deep. 
     Years ago, I took part in a unique event called the Athens to Atlanta Road Skate—a long-distance inline skating marathon across open roads in Georgia. 
     I completed the full 87-mile course in about 8 hours and have also skated the 38-mile segment in just over 3. It’s still one of my favorite stories to tell.
     
     Originally from South Louisiana, Cajun culture is in my roots. Since moving to Atlanta, I’ve had the chance to explore all kinds of new cuisines, 
     and Indian food has quickly become one of my favorites—thanks to some awesome former housemates who introduced me to it. These days, I can’t resist a good thali plate!
